			<h1>Server Not Found</h1>
			
			<p>Uh oh! Unfortunately BNFox can't find the server.</p>
			
			<p>It could be one of the following reason:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Check the address for typing errors such as ww.example.com instead of www.example.com</li>
				<li>If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer network connection.</li>
				<li>If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.</li>
			</ul>
