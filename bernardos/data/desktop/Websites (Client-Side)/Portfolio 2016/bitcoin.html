								<p>I encountered the word "Bitcoin" in early 2013 (secondary two) on an online webmasters forums. I joined that webmasters forums because I wanted to purchase a top-level domain name using a centralized virtual currency. While I was freelancing for the centralized virtual currency, I learnt about Bitcoin. <em><strong>I ignored it.</strong></em></p>
								<img class="pure-img-responsive bannerTextCentralized" src="images/bitcoin/Bitcoin_getting_started.png" alt="Bitcoin.org Getting Started">
                                <p>Sometime later (probably in mid 2013), I saw a thread about Bitcoin on the forums again. The writer stated that he will purchase a .com domain at Namecheap for just 0.01 Bitcoin (about 1 USD at that time). I became interested about Bitcoin and did some research about Bitcoin. I found out that it is a decentralized currency that anyone could use - no age limit like Paypal or credit card - so I started using it. I created my wallet on my computer the next day after reading some online documents about Bitcoin. I found a few websites that give out free Bitcoin (known as faucets) and participated in it. Addtionally, I also joined Bitcointalk (largest Bitcoin community forums) to discuss and learn more about Bitcoin. I only managed to earn 10 cents USD a week from faucets. After knowing that I could not reach 0.01 Bitcoin (1 USD) anytime soon, <em><strong>I stopped visiting those bitcoin-giving faucets and left Bitcoin.</strong></em></p>

                                <p>I went back to the "Bitcoin world" again after the price <strong>skyrocketed from 100 USD to 1000 USD per coin in early 2014.</strong> That also mean, <strong>my hard earned 10 cents became 1 USD!</strong> <em>I could have make a fortune if I continue to use faucets or buy a few Bitcoin back then.</em> Then I made a batch of Satoshi (smallest unit of Bitcoin) this time. This encounter doesn't last me long though. I left the community again after a few weeks.</p>

                        	<div>
                            	<p>After I released my game "Milkacrea", I found out that I need some sort of advertising to bring in new players. Then one of my members suggested me to use Bitcoin when I said that I do not have access to Paypal or Credit Card. I decided to come back to the world of cryptocurrency in late 2014 and searched for ways to earn free Bitcoin fast. To my surprise, I found out that there is something called "signature campaign" at Bitcointalk. It is bascially a campaign for members of Bitcointalk to make posts while wearing advertiser signature tags. I participated in one signature campaign and made about 20 posts in order to receive 4 USD worth of Bitcoin per week . Good money, I told myself. I continue to earn Bitcoin using this method even after my RPG was shutdown till this second. <mark>As I become more active, my membership rank increases. As my rank increases, I earn more Bitcoin per post - currently, 0.0008 Bitcoin.</mark></p>

                                <p>Knowing that the Bitcoin I earned at Bitcointalk cannot do much, <mark>I opened my own unique faucet in mid 2015 and named it "<a href="http://bitrevenues.com/" target="_blank">BitRevenues</a>".</mark> It is a free Bitcoin lottery site, where people can visit the site and claim free tickets without the need to register. Every month we will do a drawing. 60% of the total revenues of that month will be given to three lucky Bitcoin winning addresses. 30% of the revenues will be moved to next round and I will take the leftover 10% for running the free lottery game. It is getting <mark>more and more popular everyday.</mark> Despite still not earning any profit yet, I am very happy with my achivements - <mark>top 1 000 000 Alexa rank worldwide and first page on Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google for the keyword "free Bitcoin lottery".</mark></p>
