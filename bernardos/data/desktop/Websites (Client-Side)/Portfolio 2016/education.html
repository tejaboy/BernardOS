                                <p>I started my primary school education in mid 2006 at Yu Neng Primary School in Singapore. The reason being that my mother took me to Thailand after I "guarduated" from my pre-school. I studied in Thailand pre-school for about six months before my mother relised that Singapore education would benefit me more.</p>
                                <p>During my time in Thailand, I entered two pre-schools. The first one being a village pre-school. I studied there for about a week. Due to the facellities they provided and manpower they had, my mother decided to transfer me to another pre-school that provided better services and care. I enjoyed my time there then my mother decided to move back to Singapore to give me a better education.</p>
                                <p>When I came back to Singapore, I joined Yu Neng Primary School as a primary one student. Primary one year was a very struggling for me for e.g. I have not learnt Chinsese Han Yu Pin Yin which my classmates did learnt during their first few months. Luckily I have good classmates and teachers who helped me.</p>

								<img class="pure-img-responsive bannerTextCentralized" src="images/education/bedokgreensecondaryschool.jpg" alt="Bedok Green Secondary School">
                                <p>I applied for Bedok Green Secondary School (BGSS) and I managed to get into their Normal Technical stream. There, I met many kind, friendly, patience and supporting teachers. <mark>I managed to get top in computer application (CPA) for four consecutive years.</mark> The problem? I disliked most of my classmates as I think they are very noisy.</p>
                                
                                <p>However, all that have changed after the secondary two camp which I have bonded with my classmates and thus understand them more for three days. I started to accept my classmates and find them enjoyeable. I am thankful for that camp and enjoyed it very much which I have not thought before that the camp would have such a huge impact on my my classmates relationship with me(oh, that was also my first camp). Since then, I imporved my relationship with my classmates and stopped being addicted to gaming (which I was addicited to gaming since primary five) - and started working on making profitable websites on my free time. With good relationship with classmates and not an addicited gamer anymore, <mark>I managed to become the top student in my school (NT stream) for N Level.</mark></p>

								<p>I applied for Nitic in Social Media and Web Development at ITE Central as I have a strong interest in developing web application. I do not mind taking an hour of bus ride from my house to my school as long as it is a course of my interest. I have friendly and kind (eh?) classmates and a very funny CA. I do not have anything to put on here as I just started out my ITE journey. So, why dont you head over to the Freelance page now?</p>
